# Senior-Design-Project "Cooler, Cooler"

Designed and manufactured a portable, soft, and malleable cooler capable of maintaining contents at a target temperature over extended periods across varying climates. The project integrated material selection, mechanical design, and manufacturing processes, utilizing precision-stitched seams and a waterproofing treatment to achieve structural integrity, thermal performance, and manufacturability.
